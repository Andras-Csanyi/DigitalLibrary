# Digital Library Project 
This project is about how to manage huge amount of different documents while you can manage 
the content connections between them. The problem space this project tries to find a good
solution are the following:

 - ETL documents in from different sources in different format
 - managing content and relations between different documents and/or its sections
 - user interface for reading, where the document connections are displayed in the way it elevates
 the reading experience
 - support for writing a document where including other document references is easy
 - support for searching through the stored documents
 - support for different searching such as full text, thesaurus, etc.
